    description: 'Pandavas live peacefully and gain respect',
    moreInfo: `Delighted because of their love for them, the townspeople's loud cries rose up to heaven and increased the Pandavas' fame.\n\n'Without threats from anywhere, the Pandavas lived there, studying the Vedas and various other shastras. They were respected by all the people. The townspeople were delighted with the purity of Yudhishthira, the strength of Bhima, the valour of Arjuna, the humility of the twins and the submissiveness of Kunti to her elders. The entire world was content with their quality of valour.\n\n'After a few years, in an assembly of kings where the maiden Krishna was to choose her own bridegroom, Arjuna performed a difficult task and won her hand. From that day, he was respected by everyone in the world as a great archer. He became like a sun in the battlefield, difficult to behold. He defeated all the kings and all the main tribes.`,

    description: 'Arrival of Ugrashrava at Naimisharanya',
    moreInfo: `It was clearly a later addition and sets out the background for the recital of the story and summarizes the main incidents, not once, but twice.\n\n'Jaya' must be recited after having bowed in obeisance before Narayana and also Nara, the supreme human being, and also the goddess Sarasvati.\n\nThe great sages, performers of difficult austerities, were present at the twelve-year sacrifice of Kulapati Shounaka and were comfortably seated in Naimisharanya. Ugrashrava, the son of Lomaharshana and the son of a suta, learned in the Puranas, and also known as Souti, once approached them, bowing in humility.\n\nWhen he reached the hermitage of Naimisharanya, the hermits who were the inhabitants, surrounded him, wishing to hear his wonderful stories.\n\nHaving been respectfully welcomed by those sages, he folded his palms before all those sages and asked them how their ascetic pursuits were progressing.\n\nWhen all the sages had taken their seats again, Lomaharshana's son respectfully took the seat earmarked for him.\n\nOn seeing that he was comfortably seated and noticing that he was rested from his fatigue, one of the sages began the conversation and said: 'O lotus-eyed! O Souti! I am asking you. Tell me the details of where you have come from. Also, where have you spent the time?'\n\nSouti said: 'The great-souled royal sage and lord of earth, Janamejaya, the son of Parikshit, organized a snakesacrifice. There, in his presence, Vaishampayana recited properly the wonderful and sacred stories composed by Krishna Dvaipayana. After listening to those diverse stories of the Mahabharata, I wandered among several places of pilgrimage and sacred waters.`,

    description: 'Pandu retires to the forest',
    moreInfo: `Yudhishthira is a great tree created out of righteousness, Arjuna is its trunk, Bhima is its branches, the two sons of Madri are its plentiful fruit and flowers, and Krishna, Brahma and the Brahmanas are the root.\n\n'After having conquered many countries with war and valour, Pandu retired to the forest with the sages, because he was fond of hunting. When out hunting, he brought great misfortune on himself by killing a stag when it was with its mate. Since their birth, Pritha's sons spent their lives there, according to the prescribed norms. In accordance with what is laid down in law, their two mothers conceived sons from Dharma, Vayu, Shakra and the two gods, the Ashvins. They grew up under the care of their two mothers and in the society of holy sages, in sacred groves and forests. Then, on their own, the sages took them to the presence of Dhritarashtra and his sons. They were dressed as brahmacharis and students, with sacred tufts in their hair. The sages said, \"These students of ours are the sons of Pandu, your sons, brothers and friends.`,

    description: 'Arjuna approaches and circumambulates the bow',
    moreInfo: `What if a bow could change destiny? In a grand assembly, Arjuna stood before a mighty bow. He circled it with reverence, then bowed his head. In a flash, he strung the bow, grasped five arrows. With one swift shot, he pierced the target. The crowd erupted in shock and awe. Flowers rained from the heavens. Musicians played jubilant tunes. Drupada, the king, beamed with pride. Arjuna's victory was a testament to skill and destiny. In that moment, the world saw the power of focus and faith. Want more Mahabharata stories?
